## Hello World, <span style="color: #8F6E4D;">I'm Simone</span> ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a humble Software Developer with a heart that beats faster for front-end development.  
I enjoy crafting something functional while making it visually pleasingâ€”and, of course, awesome in the process!  
Though difficult to admit, I probably reach my **Nirvana** when I'm able to transform a challenging design into reality.

When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me at the **gym**, **cooking**, or in **Dutch classes**.  
Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about any of these things!
